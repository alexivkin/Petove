# PeTOVe, a system virtualizer

This is a bash script that allows you to take a **P**hysical system and convert it **to** a **V**irtual clone, resembing the original as close as possible in all aspects or hardware. That includes processor IDs, motherboard and hard drive serial numbers, MAC and much more.
Using this script you can create a system that is indistinguishable from the original from Microsoft Windows' and Office's standpoint from the original, thereby avoiding reactivation of these products. It also works on systems that have full disk encryption or other products tied to the hardware, like RSA key generators.

* Requires an ability to boot the original with an exteral usb
* Uses VirtualBox as the target virtualization platform

## How it works

You run this script after booting your original system with a linux recovery usb. It takes a hardware snapshot and creates another script that you can then run on your VirtualBox host. That script creates the guest VM and configures its virtual hardware.
You will need to clone the source disk with the dd and then convert it to a format readable by VirtualBox. You dont have to clone the blank space. By using the "growable" format the disk size will match the original on the guest system, but only take enough space on the host to accomodate your data.

## How to use it

### Prep the source system
If your orignal system is Windows, make sure that AHCI drivers are enabled. Open regedit and set start to 0 under
````
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\atapi
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\iaStor
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\iaStorV
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\msahci
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\pciide
````
Reboot, and go into your Bios to make sure that the drives are set to AHCI. If they are SCSI, change to AHCI. Neither VirtualBox, not VMWare have virtual SCSI interfaces.
Continue booting. Windows will install the missing AHCI drivers on boot.

Next you will need to clone your original system's harddrive. If you have enough space on your host to accommodate the full size of your original's harddrive, you can proceed to the next section. If you want to have your clone consume less space on the host than the harddrive size of your original system, read on:

1. Remove all extra partitions you do not need. If you have a "System boot" partition, use Windows' Disk Management MMC to delete it and mark your "C:" partition as "boot". Reboot your system to force Windows to move all its systems files to the "C:" partition.
2. Reduce the size of your partition:
	1. Run a cleanup tool and remove any junk you may have.
    2. Disable hibernation to remove the hibernation file.
    3. Reduce or make the swap equal to 0 to minimize (or remove) the swap file.
    4. Use the Disk Management MMC to reduce your "C:" partition size to something that you can afford to have as a virtual disk. This will be the real size required on the host.
2. Make sure your only partition starts at the beginning of the disk. If it does not, use Disk Management or some other partition editing tool (gparted) to move it to the beginning of the disk.
3. If you don't have full disk encryption, run a free space zeroing tool like sdelete. This way you will be able to use virtualbox's disk reduce feature after it is converted to vdi, so the disk takes even less space on the host.

### Preparations on the host
1. Make a Linux based recovery OS. [SystemRescueCd](https://www.system-rescue-cd.org/SystemRescueCd_Homepage) is a decent option. Turning the SystemRescue ISO into a USB is a four step process: get the ISO, mount it with "-o loop,exec", plug usb without mounting it, run `./usb_inst.sh` from the mounted iso
2. Find enough space on your host to accomodate the "C:" partition you will be cloning. It does not have to accomodate the whole disk of your original system, but should at the very least fit the partition you are copying. Make sure you can connect over the network to that space from the linux recovery usb. sshfs for Linux host or smbclient/smbfs for the Windows host should work.
3. Copy the code of this folder into the host folder you have mounted. Make sure to copy `biosdecode`, `dmidecode`, `lsusb` if they are missing from your linux recovery USB distro. They are missing in SystemRescueCD.

### Take a snapshot of your source system
1. Shut the system down and boot into a Linux recovery OS.
2. Mount a remote folder via sshfs or smbfs to some folder, like /mnt/temp
3.  Take the fingerprint of the system by running
```
clone-physical-to-virtual.sh systemname
```
This will generate a bash script config_VMname.sh for creating the VM and setting the appropriate parameters
4. Take a snapshot of the disk. clone-physical-to-virtual.sh will give you correct command for the first partition. You only need to copy enough data to cover the size of your partition (i.e. no need to copy the empty space at the end of the disk). Make sure you are copying the full disk, not a partition (eg. /dev/sda not /dev/sda1). Here is how to copy a drive with a 50G partition:
```
dd if=/dev/sda of=/mnt/temp/fulldisk.dd bs=1M count=50000
```

### Create the virtual clone on your host
1. Convert raw disk image to vdi:
```
vboxmanage convertfromraw fulldisk.dd fulldisk.vdi
```
2. Run the generated config_VMname.sh script.
You can modify the script as necessary, or recreate it by running clone-physical-to-virtual.sh with the data you captured before in the same folder.
If your target host is windows, convert bash to batch, or run bash under windows bash/cygwin.

## Troubleshooting
* The script is not tested thorougly, so if you run into issues, look through the code.
* To see what was options were set on the VM run `vboxmanage getextradata VMname enumerate` or just crack open the .vbox file. It's an XML.


## Notes on re-activation

When comparing physical to virtual some differences will show up. They are not significant to cause windows re-activation, but they might cause Office 2013 to reactivate.
Windows does (re)install a bunch of drivers, including cpu, usb devices etc. and that probably **triggered office reactivation warning.** Note though that this does not happen for all versions of office distributions. Some seems to be fine and do not need to be reactivated.
The VM had the same number of processors, the same ram and the same exact disk size (to byte) BUT when looking at the Windows Device manager the following differences show up:

Physical/Virtual:
* Disk drives: **SCSI** disk device/**ATA** Device
* Display Adapters - Intel(R) HD Graphics Family/VirtualBox Graphics Adapter
* HID - four hid devices/one USB hid
* IDA ATA/ATAPI - Intel(R) Chipset Family SATA AHCI Controller/Intel(R) ICH8M SATA AHCI Controller + ATA Channel 0, ATA Channel 1
* Keyboards - Standard 101/102 Key or Microsoft Natural/Standard PS/2 Keyboard
* Mice - Synaptics SMBus TouchPad/HID-compliant mouse, Micorsoft PS/2 mouse
* Monitors - generic PnP monitor/generic **Non-**Pnp monitor
* Netwirk adaptes - Intel Dual Band Wireless AC + Intel Ethernet Connection/Intel Pro/1000 MT Desktop Adapter
* CPU - 4 i7-4600U @ 2.10G â€” **although this was added into VBoxInternal/Devices/pcbios/0/Config/DmiProcVersion it did not come through the end system, instead the real processor type was exposed**/2 i7-4790K @ 4G
* Sound - IDT High Dev Audio CODEC/High Definition Audio Device
* System devices - **Many** differences
* USB controllers - Generic Hub+Intel UBM EHC, Intel USB3 XHC,etc/USB Root hub and standart stuff

Only present in the Physical machine:
* Imaging Devices - Webcam
* Security devices - TPM 1.2

Only present on the VM clone:
* CD-Rom
